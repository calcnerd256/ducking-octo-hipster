This tool makes it easy to create and view truth tables in a web browser. In a
"variable" column, "true" and "false" values exist for each combination of
variable values -- so if five variables are added, 32 rows will be
automatically created, each containing a unique combination of variable values.
When at least one variable column exists, it is possible to add an "operation"
column which applies a binary boolean operator to operands chosen from the
columns that have been added. This means it is easy to create truth tables for
complex compositions of binary operations by building them up one operation at
a time.
